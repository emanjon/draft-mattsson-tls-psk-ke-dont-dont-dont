NULL Encryption and Key Exchange Without Forward Secrecy are Dicouraged
            draft-mattsson-tls-psk-ke-dont-dont-dont-latest

Abstract

   Massive pervasive monitoring attacks using key exfiltration and made
   possible by key exchange without forward secrecy have been reported.
   If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman is used, static exfiltration
   of the long-term authentication keys enables passive attackers to
   compromise all past and future connections.  Malicious actors can get
   access to long-term keys in different ways: physical attacks,
   hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply
   demanding access to keying material with or without a court order.
   Exfiltration attacks are a major cybersecurity threat.  If NULL
   encryption is used an on-path attacker can read all application data.
   The use of psk_ke and NULL encryption are not following zero trust
   principles of minimizing the impact of breach and governments have
   already made deadlines for their deprecation.  This document sets the
   Recommended values of psk_ke, TLS_SHA256_SHA256, TLS_SHA384_SHA384,
   ffdhe2048 to "D" and the Recommended values of rsa_pkcs1_sha256,
   rsa_pkcs1_sha384, and rsa_pkcs1_sha512 to "N".

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8447] added a Recommended column to many of the TLS registries.
   The Recommended column did originally non-normatively indicate
   parameters that are generally recommended for implementations to
   support.  The meaning of the column was changed by
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8447bis] to indicate that the IETF has consensus
   that the item is RECOMMENDED, i.e., using normative [RFC2119]
   language.  [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8447bis] also introduced a third value
   "D" indicating that an item is discouraged and SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT
   be used.  This means that all current values need to be reevaluated.
   The current values also need to be reevaluated as attacks, government
   requirements, and best practices have changed in the more than 4
   years since [RFC8446] and [RFC8447] were published.

   This document evaluates TLS 1.3 pre-shared key exchange modes,
   (EC)DHE groups, signature algorithms, and cipher suites and changes
   the values in the Recommended column for psk_ke, TLS_SHA256_SHA256,
   TLS_SHA384_SHA384, ffdhe2048, rsa_pkcs1_sha256, rsa_pkcs1_sha384, and
   rsa_pkcs1_sha512.  The document does not evaluate TLS 1.2 parameters.
   TLS 1.2 is obsolete [RFC8446] and NIST requires support for TLS 1.3
   by January 1, 2024 [NIST-TLS].  This means that two NIST compatible
   implementations will never negotiate TLS 1.2 at the time this
   document would be published.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Key Exchange Without Forward Secrecy

   Key exchange without forward secrecy enables passive monitoring
   [RFC7258].  Massive pervasive monitoring attacks using key
   exfiltration and made possible by key exchange without forward
   secrecy have been reported [Heist], and many more have likely
   happened without ever being reported.  If key exchange without
   Diffie-Hellman is used, access to the long-term authentication keys
   enables passive attackers to compromise all past and future
   connections.  Malicious actors can get access to long-term keys in
   different ways: physical attacks, hacking, social engineering
   attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding access to keying material
   with or without a court order.  Exfiltration attacks are a major
   cybersecurity threat [Exfiltration].

   All cipher suites without forward secrecy have been marked as NOT
   RECOMMENDED in TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8447bis], and static RSA and
   DH are forbidden in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].  A large number of TLS
   profiles and implementations forbid the use of key exchange without
   Diffie-Hellman.

   *  ANSSI states that for all versions of TLS: "The perfect forward
      secrecy property must be ensured" [ANSSI-TLS].

   *  The general 3GPP TLS 1.2 profile follows [RFC9113] and states:
      "Only cipher suites with AEAD (e.g., GCM) and PFS (e.g.  ECDHE,
      DHE) shall be supported" [TS.33.210].

   *  BoringSSL has chosen to not implement psk_ke, so that TLS 1.3
      resumption always incorporates fresh key material [BoringSSL].

   Unfortunately, TLS 1.3 allows key exchange without forward secrecy in
   both full handshakes and resumption handshakes with the psk_ke.  As
   stated in [RFC8446], psk_ke does not fulfill one of the fundamental
   TLS 1.3 security properties, namely "Forward secret with respect to
   long-term keys".  When the PSK is a group key, which is now formally
   allowed in TLS 1.3 [RFC9257], psk_ke fails yet another one of the
   fundamental TLS 1.3 security properties, namely "Secrecy of the
   session keys" [Akhmetzyanova] [RFC9257].  PSK authentication has yet
   another big inherent weakness as it often does not provide
   "Protection of endpoint identities".  It could be argued that PSK
   authentication should be not recommended solely based on this
   significant privacy weakness.  The 3GPP radio access network that to
   a large degree relies on PSK are fixing the vulnerabilities by
   augmenting PSK with ECIES and ECDHE, see Annex C of [TS.33.501] and
   [I-D.ietf-emu-aka-pfs].

   Together with ffdhe2048 and rsa_pkcs1, psk_ke is one of the bad
   apples in the standards track TLS 1.3 fruit basket.  Organizations
   like BSI [BSI] has already produced recommendations regarding its
   deprecation.

   *  BSI states regarding psk_ke that "This mode should only be used in
      special applications after consultation of an expert." and has set
      a deadline that use is only allowed until 2026.

   Two essential zero trust principles are to assume that breach is
   inevitable or has likely already occurred [NSA-ZT], and to minimize
   impact when breach occur [NIST-ZT].  One type of breach is key
   compromise or key exfiltration.  Different types of exfiltration are
   defined and discussed in [RFC7624].  Static exfiltration where the
   keys are transferred once has a lower risk profile than dynamic
   exfiltration where keying material or content is transferred to the
   attacker frequently.  Forcing an attacker to do dynamic exfiltration
   minimizes the impact of breach and should be considered best
   practice.  This significantly increases the risk of discovery for the
   attacker.

   One way to force an attacker to do dynamic exfiltration is to
   frequently rerun ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  For IPsec, ANSSI
   [ANSSI-PFS] recommends enforcing periodic rekeying with ephemeral
   Diffie-Hellman, e.g., every hour and every 100 GB of data, in order
   to limit the impact of a key compromise.  This should be considered
   best practice for all protocols and systems.  The Double Ratchet
   Algorithm in the Signal protocol [Signal] enables very frequent use
   of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  The practice of frequently rerunning
   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman follows directly from the two zero trust
   principles mentioned above.

   In TLS 1.3, the application_traffic_secret can be rekeyed using
   key_update, a resumption handshake, or a full handshake.  The term
   forward secrecy is not very specific, and it is often better to talk
   about the property that compromise of key A does not lead to
   compromise of key B.  Figure 1 illustrates the impact of some
   examples of static key exfiltration when psk_ke, key_update, and
   (ec)dhe are used for rekeying.  Each time period Tᵢ uses a single
   application_traffic_secret. ✘ means that the attacker has access to
   the application_traffic_secret in that time period and can passively
   eavesdrop on the communication. ✔ means that the attacker does not
   have access to the application_traffic_secret.  Exfiltration and
   frequently rerunning EC(DHE) is discussed in Appendix F of
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   Modern ephemeral key exchange algorithms like x25519 [RFC7748] are
   very fast and have small message overhead.  The public keys are 32
   bytes long and the cryptographic operations take 53 microseconds per
   endpoint on a single core AMD Ryzen 5 5560U [eBACS-DH].  Ephemeral
   key exchange with the quantum-resistant algorithm Kyber that NIST
   will standardize is even faster.  For the current non-standardized
   version of Kyber512 the cryptographic operations take 12 microseconds
   for the client and 8 microseconds for the server [eBACS-KEM].

   Unfortunately, psk_ke is marked as "Recommended" in the IANA
   PskKeyExchangeMode registry.  This may severely weaken security in
   deployments following the "Recommended" column.  Introducing TLS 1.3
   in 3GPP had the unfortunate and surprising effect of drastically
   lowering the minimum security when TLS is used with PSK
   authentication.  Some companies in 3GPP have been unwilling to mark
   psk_ke as not recommended as it is so clearly marked as "Recommended"
   by the IETF.  By labeling psk_ke as "Recommended", IETF is
   legitimizing and implicitly promoting bad security practice.

   This document sets the Recommended value of psk_ke to "D" indicating
   discouraged.

3.  Cipher Suites with NULL Encryption

   Cipher suites with NULL encryption enables passive monitoring
   [RFC7258] and were completely removed from TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].
   Unfortunately, the independent stream document [RFC9150] reintroduced
   cipher suites with NULL Encryption in TLS 1.3 even though NULL
   encryption violates several of the fundamental TLS 1.3 security
   properties, namely "Protection of endpoint identities",
   "Confidentiality", and "Length concealment".  Some companies in 3GPP
   have already suggested to use [RFC9150] in QUIC but luckily this is
   forbidden by [RFC9001] and hopefully it will stay like that.

   Modern encryption algorithms like AES-GCM [RFC5288] are very fast and
   have small message overhead.  Upcoming algorithms like AEGIS
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-aegis-aead] is much faster than AES-GCM [AEGIS-PERF].
   NULL encryption has no raison d'être in two-party protocols.

   Two essential zero trust principles are to assume that breach is
   inevitable or has likely already occurred [NSA-ZT], and to minimize
   impact when breach occur [NIST-ZT].  One type of breach is an on-path
   attacker present on the enterprise network.  In [NIST-ZT2], NIST
   states as the first basic assumption for network connectivity for any
   organization that utilizes Zero trust is that:

   *  "The entire enterprise private network is not considered an
      implicit trust zone.  Assets should always act as if an attacker
      is present on the enterprise network, and communication should be
      done in the most secure manner available.  This entails actions
      such as authenticating all connections and encrypting all
      traffic."

   This document sets the Recommended value of TLS_SHA256_SHA256 and
   TLS_SHA384_SHA384 to "D" indicating discouraged.

4.  2048-bit Finite Field Diffie-Hellman

   Government organizations like NIST, ANSSI, BSI, and NSA have already
   produced recommendations regarding the deprecation of ffdhe2048.
   NIST [NIST-Lifetime] and ANSSI [ANSSI-TLS] only allow 2048-bit Finite
   Field Diffie-Hellman if the application data does not have to be
   protected after 2030.  If the application data had a security life of
   ten years, NIST and ANSSI allowed use of ffdhe2048 until December 31,
   2020.  BSI [BSI] allowed use of ffdhe2048 up to the year 2022.  The
   Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA) [RFC9151] forbids
   the use of ffdhe2048.  This document sets the Recommended value of
   ffdhe2048 to "D" indicating discouraged.

5.  Signature Algorithms with PKCS #1 v1.5 Padding

   Recommendations regarding RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 varies.  The RSA
   Cryptography Specifications [RFC8017] specifies that "RSASSA-PSS is
   REQUIRED in new applications.  RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is included only for
   compatibility with existing applications.".  BSI [BSI] allows use of
   the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding scheme in TLS certificates up to the year
   2025.  The Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) [RFC9151]
   requires offer of rsa_pkcs1_sha384 . This document sets the
   Recommended value of rsa_pkcs1_sha256, rsa_pkcs1_sha384, and
   rsa_pkcs1_sha512 to "N".

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry under
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters heading.  For psk_ke
   the "Recommended" value has been set to "D" indicating that the item
   is "Discouraged".

   IANA is requested to update the TLS Cipher Suites registry under the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters heading.  For
   TLS_SHA256_SHA256 and TLS_SHA384_SHA384 the "Recommended" value has
   been set to "D" indicating that the items are "Discouraged".

   IANA is requested to update the TLS Supported Groups registry under
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters heading.  For ffdhe2048
   the "Recommended" value has been set to "D" indicating that the item
   is "Discouraged".

   IANA is requested to update the TLS SignatureScheme registry under
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters heading.  For
   rsa_pkcs1_sha256, rsa_pkcs1_sha384, and rsa_pkcs1_sha512 the
   "Recommended" value has been set to "N".
